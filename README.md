# Satellite Image Manipulation Detection

## About
This project focuses on detecting manipulations in satellite images using deep learning. Aimed at enhancing the reliability of satellite data, particularly for critical applications like environmental monitoring and national security.

## Dataset
I work with a pre-manipulated dataset designed to represent common distortions in satellite imagery.

## Approach
- **Deep Learning**: Leveraging ___ for efficient manipulation detection.
- **Evaluation**: Utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure performance.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
pip install -r requirements.txt
